# Angular BlocJams

A Spotify-esque music streaming service, allowing users to listen to all of their favorite albums at the click of a button. The code was initially written with [JavaScript (Checkpoint 15)](https://github.com/baka-san/bloc-jams/tree/checkpoint-15-html-css), but then later rewritten with [jQuery](https://github.com/baka-san/bloc-jams).
